🌳 Titanic Survivors Classification using Decision Tree (From Scratch)
This project shows how to implement a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using Python, trained on the Titanic dataset.
It’s ideal for learners who want to deeply understand how decision trees actually work — without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

✍️ Full Explanation on Medium: Soon to be published
